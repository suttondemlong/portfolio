          <p className="about-text">I am a junior developer specializing in Ruby on Rails and React. 
          In a previous life, I studied fine arts and managed a woodworking/sculpor-for-hire studio.
          I gained experience writing code while working with the Arduino IDE to create interactive sculptures. 
          Working with Arduinos and being a part of that open source community sparked my passion 
          for learning programming languages and the open source ideology. 
          <br />
          <br />
          As an artist, I developed a thirst for understanding how the infinite iterations of
          peopleâ€™s perspectives clash, synchronize and ultimately weave together the fabric of our society.
          This love of community combined with my passion for building fuels my practice as a developer. 
          It is the reason why I am an excellent team member and it is what inspires me to use software 
          engineering to create a positive impact on the world.
