          <p className="about-text">I am a junior developer with a background in fine arts and production based woodworking.
          As a production manager at LANNINGSMITH Studios, I learned how to navigate teams of unique individuals,
          balance client expectations with production realities and problem solve/pivot with a looming deadline.
          Through my art practice, I have developed a thirst for understanding how the infinite iterations of
          peopleâ€™s perspectives clash, synchronize and ultimately weave together the fabric of our society.
          This passion combined with my love for building fuels my practice as a developer. It is the reason
          why I excel as a team member as well as a project lead and it is what inspires me to use software
          engineering to create a positive impact on the world.</p>
